1.) Load the data into a register memory

2.) Process the data
	- Do whatever the operation is

3.) Write back teh result 
	- Either in a register memory
	- Or main memory

Register Memory:
	- Fastest memory a computer has
	- Expensive piece of memory
	- Cannot use it for RAM

Memory Hierarchy
	Level 1: Register memory 	-> 10xL1 cache memory cost (most expensive)
	Level 2: L1 cache  			-> 10xL2 cache memory cost
	Level 3: L2 Cache			-> 10xL3 cache memory cost
	Level 4: L3 Cache			-> 10xRam cost per bit
	Level 5: RAM				-> Fastest Memory(Factor of 1)

Raspberry Pi Registers:
	* R0, ...,  R11
		- Safe to Use
	* R112, R13, R14
		-  Special use cases
	* R15
		- Used for a special purpose
		- Used for "PC"
		- "Program Counter"
			-> Address wise tells where the memory is

// Move a value(13) to Register 15
mov R15, 13
